### ABOUT PAGE

**Headline:** Built on Reputation, Driven by Craftsmanship

Hi, I'm Daniel Martinez, and I've been building outdoor spaces in the Columbia Basin for over 20 years.

I started Martinez Mowing & More in 2021 because I saw too many homeowners—especially here in Desert Aire—getting burned by contractors who overpromised, underdelivered, or disappeared halfway through a job.

I wanted to build something different. A company where your project gets done right, on time, and with the kind of attention to detail that makes you excited to show it off to your neighbors.

**What Makes Us Different:**

- **Licensed & Insured:** General Contractor #MARTIMM744B1. We pull permits, follow code, and stand behind every project.
- **Desert Aire Specialists:** We know the HOA requirements, the soil conditions, and what plants actually thrive in this climate.
- **One Crew, One Standard:** I'm on every job. My team has been with me for years. You won't get handed off to a subcontractor who's never met you.
- **No Surprises:** Clear quotes, realistic timelines, and honest communication from estimate to final walkthrough.

Whether it's a custom fence to frame your view, a new irrigation system to keep your lawn green through summer, or monthly maintenance so you can actually enjoy your weekends—we treat your property like it's our own.

Let's build something you'll love coming home to.

### SERVICE PAGES

#### FENCES

**Headline:** Custom Fences That Frame Your Desert Aire Property Perfectly

Your fence is more than a boundary—it's the first thing guests notice, the backdrop to every backyard gathering, and the foundation of your outdoor privacy.

We specialize in custom wood, vinyl, and composite fencing designed specifically for Desert Aire's wind, sun, and HOA standards. Whether you need a privacy fence for your backyard oasis, a decorative border for your front yard, or a secure enclosure for your pets, we build it to last.

**What's Included:**
- Custom design consultation
- HOA compliance review
- Professional-grade materials (cedar, vinyl, composite)
- Concrete footings for wind resistance
- Post-installation cleanup
- Workmanship warranty

**Average Investment:** $8,000  
**Timeline:** Most fences completed in 3-5 days

Your fence should enhance your property value and your peace of mind. Let's build it right the first time.

#### PLANTS & SOD INSTALLATION

**Headline:** Lush, Green Landscapes That Thrive in the Columbia Basin

Desert Aire's climate is beautiful—but it's tough on lawns and plants. We've spent two decades figuring out exactly what works here: which sod varieties handle the heat, which plants survive the wind, and how to design landscapes that look resort-quality without needing resort-level maintenance.

**Our Approach:**
- **Site Analysis:** Soil testing, sun exposure mapping, and drainage assessment
- **Smart Plant Selection:** Drought-tolerant, wind-resistant, HOA-compliant species
- **Premium Sod:** We source varieties proven to thrive in Central Washington
- **Irrigation Integration:** New plantings tied into your existing system (or we'll design a new one)
- **Seasonal Timing:** We install when success rates are highest—not when it's convenient for us

**Average Investment:** $6,000  
**Timeline:** Most installs completed in 1-3 days

Whether you're starting from scratch or refreshing tired landscaping, we'll create something that makes your neighbors ask, "Who did your yard?"

---

#### PROPERTY MAINTENANCE

**Headline:** Year-Round Maintenance So You Can Actually Enjoy Your Property

You bought in Desert Aire to enjoy the lifestyle—not to spend your weekends edging, blowing, and trimming.

Our property maintenance service keeps your outdoor space looking sharp year-round, so you can spend your time on the golf course, the lake, or anywhere that isn't behind a lawnmower.

**What's Included:**
- Weekly or bi-weekly mowing (seasonal)
- Edging, trimming, and blowing
- Spring cleanup and bed prep
- Fall leaf removal
- Sprinkler system winterization (blowouts)
- On-call service for HOA compliance issues

**Monthly Investment:** $300-700 (based on property size and frequency)

We show up on time, work quietly, and leave your property better than we found it—every single time.

---

#### RETAINING WALLS

**Headline:** Retaining Walls That Solve Problems and Add Value

Sloped yards, erosion issues, and unusable spaces—retaining walls fix them all while adding structure and beauty to your landscape.

We design and build retaining walls using block, stone, or timber, engineered for Desert Aire's soil and drainage conditions. Whether you're creating a terraced garden, protecting a foundation, or adding dimension to a flat yard, we build walls that last decades, not years.

**What We Deliver:**
- Structural engineering (for walls over 4')
- Proper drainage to prevent failure
- Material options: Allan Block, natural stone, timber
- Grading and backfill
- Permit coordination

Retaining walls are one of the highest-ROI outdoor improvements you can make. Let's design yours.

---

#### DECKS, PERGOLAS & OUTDOOR STRUCTURES

**Headline:** Custom Outdoor Structures That Extend Your Living Space

Your backyard should feel like a destination—not an afterthought.

We design and build custom decks, pergolas, patio covers, and gazebos that turn unused outdoor space into your favorite place to entertain, relax, and unplug.

**Our Specialties:**
- **Custom Decks:** Cedar, composite, or Trex. Built for BBQs, sunsets, and family time.
- **Pergolas:** Shade, style, and architectural interest.
- **Patio Covers:** Extend your season with weather protection.
- **Gazebos:** Standalone structures for gardens, hot tubs, or outdoor dining.

Every structure is custom-designed for your space, your style, and your budget. We handle permits, engineering, and HOA approvals—you just pick the finishes.

Let's build the backyard you've been dreaming about.

---

#### IRRIGATION & DRAINAGE

**Headline:** Smart Irrigation That Saves Water and Keeps Everything Green

Desert Aire's climate means irrigation isn't optional—it's essential. But a poorly designed system wastes thousands of gallons (and hundreds of dollars) every summer.

We design, install, and repair irrigation systems that deliver the right amount of water exactly where it's needed—no more brown spots, no more runoff, no more sky-high water bills.

**Services:**
- **New System Design & Installation:** Zoned for efficiency, programmed for your landscape
- **System Repairs:** Broken lines, faulty valves, controller issues
- **Seasonal Blowouts:** Protect your investment before winter
- **French Drains:** Solve drainage problems before they damage your foundation
- **Gravel & Rock Work:** Decorative rock, pathways, and dry creek beds

Your irrigation system should work quietly in the background—you shouldn't have to think about it. We make sure you don't have to.

Hola, soy Daniel Martinez, y he estado construyendo espacios al aire libre en la Cuenca de Columbia por más de 20 años.

Comencé Martinez Mowing & More en 2021 porque vi a demasiados propietarios—especialmente aquí en Desert Aire—siendo estafados por contratistas que prometían demasiado, entregaban poco, o desaparecían a mitad de un trabajo.
