## 🧠 CONVERSION PSYCHOLOGY APPLIED

### **The 7 Principles (Cialdini):**
1. **Authority:** Licensed GC badge, 20+ years experience
2. **Social Proof:** "Trusted by Desert Aire Homeowners"
3. **Unity:** "We live here. We work here."
4. **Scarcity:** "Spring calendar filling fast"
5. **Liking:** Daniel's photo + personal story
6. **Commitment:** Micro-steps (Learn More → Get Quote)
7. **Reciprocity:** Free estimates, value-first approach

### **Loss Aversion (Most Powerful):**
Every CTA frames what they'll **LOSE** by not acting:
- "Stop losing property value to neglected landscaping"
- "Don't let another summer pass with an unfinished yard"
- "Every day without proper irrigation costs you money"

### **Dual CTA Strategy:**
- **System 1 (Fast):** "Call Now" — emotional, instant
- **System 2 (Slow):** "Request Quote" — rational, detailed

### **Mobile Conversion:**
- Sticky bottom bar (Call | Quote) after 300px scroll
- Large touch targets (44px+)
- Animations optimized for performance

---

## 📱 MOBILE-FIRST FEATURES

- ✅ Sticky mobile CTA bar (appears after scrolling)
- ✅ Hamburger menu with slide-out navigation
- ✅ Large touch targets on all buttons
- ✅ Click-to-call phone numbers everywhere
- ✅ Optimized form fields for mobile input
- ✅ Smooth animations (hardware-accelerated)
- ✅ Fast loading (static pages, optimized assets)

---

## 🚀 READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

### **Deploy to Vercel (Recommended):**
```bash
# Connect repo to Vercel
# Auto-deploys on every push to main
# Free for personal/commercial use
```

### **Or Deploy to Netlify:**
```bash
# Build command: npm run build
# Publish directory: .next
```
